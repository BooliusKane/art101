		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure</h1>
		<p>The idea of this lab was to further create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html files</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			There wasnt much challenge as I used the template that was given, but i ran into some issues with the 
			links because I wasn't paying attention to capitalization but found the mistake and corrected it.
		</p>
		<h3>Results</h3>
		<p>
			Bellow are the results of my made file structure, the img, css, js, and index.html 
			files are all there but I am unable to show them in one picture so they are split up into two.</p>
