			<h1>Hello World</h1>

			<p>
				My name is Julius, I am an art major and I have a large amount of programming experience as I used to be a
				computer engineering major. I have a love for basketball, I play when I can but I watch more than i play and 
				growing up in Ventura which is close to LA I am a Lakers fan. In art I love to learn more and explore more 
				mediums, I prefer to work in digital media so this class is perfect for me. I am definitly a nerd as I play 
				DnD and spend most of my time on my computer trying to learn more. My partners name is Nicole, she is an art 
				major. She does not have a lot of programming experience outside of HTMl. She is also from Santa Paula, which 
				is close to Ventura. Her hobbies include drawing and playing guitar.
