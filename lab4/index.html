		<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
		<p>The idea of this was was to get in the habit of using Pseudocoding as a tool to help organize thoughts before coding.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			My only challenge was learning what the pre and code lines in my index.html file did and why they were needed. Besides that the 
			lab went very smooth.
